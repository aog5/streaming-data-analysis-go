    "One of the main mechanisms for managing state in Go is communication over channels, as we learned in the previous notebook. However, as stated in [this useful article](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/MutexOrChannel) in the official Go wiki:\n",
    "\n",

    "So what does that mean, and what the heck is a \"Mutex\"? Well, a mutex is a mutual exclusion lock that can be utilized as a rule, such that we can safely access data across multiple goroutines. More specifically, a Mutex allows us to Lock certain data (e.g., a struct) that may also be accessed by other goroutines, such that we ensure exclusive access to the data until we Unlock that data."
